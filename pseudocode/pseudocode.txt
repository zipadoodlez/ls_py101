 a function that returns the sum of two numbers

	START

	GET number 1 and number 2
	SET the sum
	PRINT the sum

a function that takes a list of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

	START
	GET list of strings
	SET new variable : stringcat
	FOR string in strings
		stringcat += strings(string)		
	PRINT stringcat

a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a new list with every other element from the original list, starting with the first element. For instance: 

	START
	GET list of integers
	SET new list of integers
	SET iterator
	WHILE iterator < len(list):
		newlist.append(list[iterator])	
		iterator += 2
	PRINT newlist

a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return None. 

	START
	GET string
	IF sub in string
	SET charcounter, index
	WHILE charcounter < 3:
		IF sub in substring[index::]
			SET index of sub in string
			SET charcounter++		
		ELSE
			PRINT less than 3 instances
			return None
	PRINT index

a function that takes two lists of numbers and returns the result of merging the lists. The elements of the first list should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned list, while the elements of the second list should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:


	START
	GET 2 lists
	SET index, returnedlist
	WHILE index < len(list1)+len(list2)		
		returnedlist.append(list1[index])
		returnedlist.append(list2[index + 1])
		index += 2
	PRINT returnedlist
